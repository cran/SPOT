\title{Meta Model Interface: Random Forest combined with Mlegp
 
A very simple ensemble which uses results from a Gaussian process model (mlegp) and a random forest.}
\usage{
spotPredictRandomForestMlegp(rawB, mergedB, largeDesign, spotConfig,
  fit = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rawB}{unmerged data}

\item{mergedB}{merged data}

\item{largeDesign}{new design points which should be predicted}

\item{spotConfig}{global list of all options, needed to provide data for calling functions}

\item{fit}{if an existing model fit is supplied, the model will not be build based on 
data, but only evaluated with the model fit (on the largeDesign data). To build the model, 
this parameter has to be NULL. If it is not NULL the parameters mergedB and rawB will not be 
used at all in the function.}
}
\value{
returns the list \code{spotConfig} with two new entries:\cr
	spotConfig$seq.modelFit fit of the model used with predict() \cr
spotConfig$seq.largeDesignY the y values of the large design, evaluated with the fit
